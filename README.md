# Introduction the ELK Stack
Up until a year or two ago, the ELK Stack was a collection of three open-source products — Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana — all developed, managed and maintained by Elastic. The introduction and subsequent addition of Beats turned the stack into a four legged project.

Elasticsearch is an open source, full-text search and analysis engine, based on the Apache Lucene search engine. Logstash is a log aggregator that collects data from various input sources, executes different transformations and enhancements and then ships the data to various supported output destinations. Kibana is a visualization layer that works on top of Elasticsearch, providing users with the ability to analyze and visualize the data. And last but not least — Beats are lightweight agents that are installed on edge hosts to collect different types of data for forwarding into the stack.

Together, these different components are most commonly used for monitoring, troubleshooting and securing IT environments (though there are many more use cases for the ELK Stack such as business intelligence and web analytics). Beats and Logstash take care of data collection and processing, Elasticsearch indexes and stores the data, and Kibana provides a user interface for querying the data and visualizing it.
